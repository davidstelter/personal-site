Guitar building is profoundly fulfilling. I learned how to do this from a lot of reading online,
and from the book ["Make Your Own Electric Guitar" by Melvyn Hiscock](http://www.melvynhiscock.com/the-book/).

It takes a decent collection of tools to make an electric guitar. Some are optional or can be worked around using a different tool,
but some are pretty much a must, like a router and tablesaw.

For online resources, the [Musical Instrument Makers Forum]("https://mimf.com") contains a wealth of knowledge,
and numerous instrument makers ranging from novice to gifted hobbyist to seasoned professional.
