Guitar building is profoundly fulfilling. I learned how to do this from a lot of reading online,
and from the book ["Make Your Own Electric Guitar" by Melvyn Hiscock](http://www.melvynhiscock.com/the-book/).

It takes a decent collection of tools to make an electric guitar. Some are optional or can be worked around using a different tool,
but some are pretty much a must, like a router and tablesaw.

For online resources, the [Musical Instrument Makers Forum]("https://mimf.com") contains a wealth of knowledge,
and numerous instrument makers ranging from novice to gifted hobbyist to seasoned professional.

Along with general woodworking tools, there are loads of specialized tools and supplies, and dedicated vendors for them.

* [Luthier's Mercantile](https://lmii.com): wood, tools, supplies
* [Stewart-MacDonald](https://stewmac.com): wood, tools, supplies
* [Allied Lutherie](https://alliedlutherie.com): wood, tools, supplies - very nice truss rods
* [Goby Walnut](https://gobywalnut.com): northwest woods, particularly walnut and maple
* [Gilmer Wood](https://gilmerwood.com): exotic woods
