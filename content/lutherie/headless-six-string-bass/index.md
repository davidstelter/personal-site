title = "Headless Six String Bass"
+++

## Design

The main goal was to have a comfortable, headless six string bass with extended high fret range - 28 frets total.

## Neck

{{img_fit_width(path="neck-laminations.jpg", width=800)}}

The neck is 7 pieces of {{wood_link(name="bubinga")}}, {{wood_link(name="wenge")}} and {{wood_link(name="purpleheart")}}, with two carbon fiber stiffeners
and a homemade truss rod.

The fingerboard is {{wood_link(name="ebony")}} with 28 stainless steel frets, shell position markers and a zero fret.

The end cap/string retainer is homemade from brass with 1/4"-20 set screws to hold the strings.

## Body

The body is {{wood_link(name="walnut")}} on the back and {{wood_link(name="wenge")}} on the front, with {{wood_link(name="purpleheart")}} rails sandwiching
the neck laminates, and {{wood_link(name="bubinga")}} behind the neck laminates.

## Bridge

The bridge is a [Hipshot Headless](https://hipshotproducts.com/collections/bass-headless/products/6-string-headless-bass-system) which has rock solid tuning
stability and smooth adjustment of action and intonation. 

## Pickups & Electronics

The pickups are [Nordstrand Fat Stacks](https://nordstrandaudio.com/collections/6-string-soapbar-bass-pickups/products/fat-stack-6) which are stacked, dual coil, tappable pickups.
They sound just fantastic, probably my favorite sounding bass pickup along with a Stingray.

The preamp is an [Audere Audio Pro Z 4-band](https://www.audereaudio.com/pro-z-vb-4b-4h-black.html) which has a really neat impedance selector that gets 3 different tones from the
pickups before you even start adjusting the 4 bands of EQ. All the tones from this preamp are good.
