This bass was fun to build. From the buttery-smooth {{wood_link(name="primavera")}} body, which was a breeze to route and carve, to the simplified one-piece {{wood_link(name="wenge")}} neck, 
it came together very smoothly.

It got picked as the ["Bass of the Week" at bestbassgear.com](https://www.bestbassgear.com/ebass/bass-of-the-week/bass-of-the-week-david-stelter-jaunty-5.html) which was flattering.

## Neck

The neck is a single, solid piece of quartersawn {{wood_link(name="wenge")}} with a 15-degree tiltback head with a hidden scarf joint, so the bulk of the head is three pieces of wood with
a thin cap on top.

The fingerboard and head cap are also wenge, and the whole neck is stained black, which looks really great on the flatsawn head cap. There are two carbon fiber bars in the neck, and a one-way truss rod adjusted
 at the body.

 Frets are medium stainless with a zero fret, the nut is a Graphtech trem nut.

The headstock joinery is a really slick design I learned by watching the [videos from LeFay](https://www.lefay.de/index.php/EN/most_recently/workshop).

## Body

 The body is two pieces of {{wood_link(name="primavera")}} joined down the middle, and the battery and electronics covers are also prima vera.

 Tuners and bridge are by Hipshot, pickups are EMG P/J set in the 40-size style running at 18v. Basic electronics, vol-vol-tone, and a Switchcraft locking jack.

 The body also got black stain, then sanded back so the stain just remained in the pores, giving it a reclaimed lumber/weathered look. The neck and body are both finished in Osmo Polyx, a floor finish which has a wonderful satiny hard-wax feel. I really wanted a classic bolt-on P/J sound from this bass and I got it!
