title = "Bubinga 7 string guitar"
+++

This was the first guitar I made. I was still learning all the basics, and had barely done any joinery with glue, just some boxes in highschool shop class.
In fact the first fingerboard I tried to glue to the neck popped right off - can't remember exactly what I did wrong with that, might have been over-clamped
with expoxy.

## Neck

The neck is a 7-piece lamination with a center of {{wood_link(name="purpleheart")}} with narrow-ish strips of {{wood_link(name="wenge")}}
and {{wood_link(name="bubinga")}} with wenge again for the outermost layers. The fingerboard is {{wood_link(name="ebony")}} though I forget
the exact species. There are 24 frets, with shell dot fret markers. The truss rod is a 2-way adjustable from [StewMac](https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/materials/truss-rods/adjustable-truss-rods/4mm-allen-nut-hot-rod-truss-rod.html)
and there are two carbon fiber stiffeners as well.

## Body

The body is made of two wings of {{wood_link(name="bubinga")}} with narrower strips of {{wood_link(name="purpleheart")}}
between the body wings and the neck-through laminations. It's a bit unusual to see a guitar with lenghtwise laminations like this in the body, but I was reading
[David King's "how I build a bass"](http://kingbass.com/build-a-bass.html) over and over while designing this guitar, and that's what he does and I loved the look.
So the purpleheart widens the neck beam enough to fully contain the routs for the pickups and bridge.

## Pickups & Electronics

Pickup selection and position is pretty standard for a hard rock/metal guitar, 2 humbuckers in the usual places. When I made this, starting around 2006 or so, 7 string humbuckers were 
still much less common than they are now, but [EMG](https://www.emgpickups.com/) had some available - exactly 3 varieties if I remember right.
The bridge pickup is an [81-7](https://www.emgpickups.com/guitar/81-7.html) and the neck is pickup is a [707](https://www.emgpickups.com/guitar/707.html).
Electronics are the usual volume, tone and 3-position pickup selector switch.

## Hardware

The bridge is a [Hipshot Contour Tremolo](https://hipshotproducts.com/collections/guitar-bridges/products/7-string-us-contour-tremolo-bridge-right-handed?variant=28320389256) which is
a simple design with a few subtle-but-nice features, like using hardened steel for the load-bearing edges of the interface between the bridge plate and the posts, and having a pleasing
friction fit for the tremolo arm.

The tuners are the locking variety, which I prefer in general for guitar and is a must with a trem, especially if you don't want to mess with a locking nut. Hipshot's locking tuners
weren't available yet, so I used [Schallers](https://schaller.info/en/m6-series/271/m6-135?number=10020471.02.52).

## Finish

For finish, as this was my first guitar and I had no experience with wood finishing aside from tung and linseed oils from highschool wood shop, I chose a widely recommended "easy" finish, 
[Tru-Oil](https://www.birchwoodcasey.com/products/tru-oil-stock-finish-8-fl-oz-liquid.html) which is indeed very forgiving. I didn't do any pore filling, which isn't really needed on bubinga
or purpleheart but is often done with the very open-pored wenge - as this wasn't a high gloss, I think it turned out pretty good.

## Issues

The only real problem with this guitar was the high-fret access. The gap between the lower horn and the neck is pretty cramped. When I made it, I honestly didn't think I'd be reaching up there
very much and I didn't care. Years later, trying to learn some solos and generally being less scared by the high-numbered frets, I ended up truncating the lower horn so my hand could fit up there.

Less of an issue, weight. All the woods involved are pretty heavy, though the relatively short length of the body after the bridge and contouring help reduce the overall mass.
